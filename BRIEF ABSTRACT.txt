BRIEF ABSTRACT

This project develops an autonomous rover designed for efficient navigation in constrained environments. The rover integrates three key functions: localization, navigation, and locomotion. Localization is achieved
using the Neo 7 GPS module, accurately determining the rover’s position. For navigation, a customized path planning algorithm calculates the
optimal route to a target location, while ultrasonic sensors facilitate real-time obstacle detection and avoidance, allowing the rover to autonomously
navigate around obstacles.
Additionally, the rover incorporates basic decision-making capabilities,
enabling it to execute simple decisions based on algorithms for route planning and obstacle avoidance. Locomotion is powered by motor drivers and
motors, ensuring reliable movement along the planned path.
The primary expected outcome is a fully functional rover capable of
perceiving its environment and navigating autonomously, without human
intervention. This integrated approach not only enhances the rover’s operational efficiency but also contributes to advancements in robotic navigation technologies, making it suitable for various applications in dynamic
terrains. The successful implementation of these features will represent a
significant step forward in the development of sophisticated autonomous
system
